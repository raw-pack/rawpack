  <strong>Git aliases and how to use them</strong>
  <span class="desc">Aliases is a helpful git feature that lets you do more typing less. Here we'll find out how to use them.</span>
</p>

<p>We will start  with a simple statement  &ndash; the less you do  and the more
you get &ndash; the  better. This means that if you  can achieve something in
three keystrokes instead of nine your performance is 3x higher. Also, if
you use an alias, you don&rsquo;t have to remember syntax for complex commands
you may want to use.</p>

<p>So how can you achieve that? The answer is aliases. Basically, nicknames
for commands  &ndash; similar  to how  you call your  friend Nick  instead of
Nicholas. And we  will start with an alias for  <code>git</code> command itself! We
are going  to shorten that  long 3-letters thing  to just one  symbol &ndash;
<code>g</code>. At first  sight this doesn&rsquo;t seem like a  big improvement, just one
keystroke instead of three, but it can save you a lot of time at the end
of the day.</p>

<p>Just  open  the  config  file  of  your  shell  of  choice  (<code>~/.zshrc</code>,
<code>~/.bashrc</code>) and put the following line to it:</p>

<pre><code>alias g=&#39;git&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Now reopen your current session and start a new one and &ndash; viola! &ndash; now
you can write  <code>g status</code> instead of that long  <code>git status</code>! Isn&rsquo;t that
cool? But we are going to improve this even more.</p>

<p>Well, basically, you can now use the  same approach to add even more git
aliases, i. e.  by using your shell  aliases. But git has  its own alias
facilities, built in right into it. They can be either global (placed in
global <code>~/.gitconfig</code>  file) or  per-repo, which can  be useful  in some
circumstances (say you have to do some routine operation but only in one
repo from a dozen).</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s jump into  it. To create a native git  alias, you can either
open <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file and add a  new entry under <code>[alias]</code> block (you
may have to create  the file and the block first) or  use git command to
manipulate its own  config file. For example, let&rsquo;s create  an alias for
the <code>status</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>g config --global alias.st status
</code></pre>

<p>Type that in, and then do <code>g st</code> in any repo. Whoa! How fast is that?!</p>

<p>I will now provide  a list of some aliases I use  daily, maybe they will
be useful for  you too. But don&rsquo;t  just stick to this list  &ndash; extend it
with your own findings!</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
co = checkout             # &quot;g co main&quot; instead of &quot;git checkout main&quot;
cm = commit -v            # &quot;g cm&quot; to commit something
amend = commit --amend    # when you want to add more changes to the current commit
reword = commit --amend   # to change commit message of the last commit you did
undo = reset --soft HEAD^ # to, well, undo the commit (without resetting changes)
df = diff --color-words   # to see inline changes
mg = merge --no-ff        # merge with explicit merge commit

# pretty history viewer with ascii-art branches, merging, etc
hist = log --pretty=format:&#39;%Cred%h%Creset %ad | %Cgreen%s%d%Creset [%an]&#39; --graph --date=short
</code></pre>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
